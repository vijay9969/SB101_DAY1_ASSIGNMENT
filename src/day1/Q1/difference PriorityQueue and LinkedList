Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().
=>A)PriorityQueue():---
A priority queue is a concept like a list or a map; 
just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or with an array, 
a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or with a variety of 
other methods such as an unordered array.

B)LinkedList():---
A linked list is a data structure where the objects are arranged in a linear order. 
Unlike an array, however, in which the linear order is determined by the array indices, 
the order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each object.
